title:  "A Raspberry Pi Bot to Play 2048"

A while back I received a Raspberry Pi as a present. After a bit of procrastination and attempts at some classic hobby projects I got the idea that it would be pretty cool to try to make a
 Raspberry Pi robot to play the [2048 game](https://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/). The idea would be to end up with a completely self-contained little bot that you can point at a screen with 2048 running on it
 and it will be able to capture the live images, interpret them, come up with the best move to make and execute that move (via some output device). But why do all this, you might ask? Well, for some time I was looking for a fun way to learn a bit about the basics of computer vision and reinforcement learning.

 Overall there are three main tasks to deal with in this project:
 1. Find a way to identify and extract the game grid with the correct numbers from an image (static photo or frame captured from a live video).
 2. Take the info extracted in 1. and decide what move should be executed next (up, down, left, right).
 3. With the use of some (hopefully) simple mechanism input the action decided in 2. on a standard keyboard (e.g. by pressing an arrow key).

 
### Part 1: processing an image with a 2048 game grid.
