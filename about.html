<p align="justify">I'm Traian, a data scientist and software developer working out of Amsterdam, NL.</p>

<p align="justify">This blog is a write down of a host of observations and explorations in statistics, computer science, software development and more. They range from little light-bulb moments I've had about certain concepts, to idiosyncratic developments of my own design.</p>

<p align="justify">I hope you'll find the content stimulating and useful.</p>
